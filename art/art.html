  <br>
  <div class="subtitle">
    <p style="margin:6px;"><u>8th august 2021 - 16th november 2021</u></p>
    <p style="margin:6px;">this might as well be its own entire section, i've made a ton of stuff for rhythm doctor custom levels and fanart in the past and it'd be impossible to fit them all in one spot. so, i'll include a rd subsection each year. ill probably also make a page specifically for rhythm doctor custom levels and my thought process behind them later</p>
  </div><br>
  <div class="rowA">
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Pizza.png" alt="" width="150px" height="150px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">pizza</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">one of the first levels i started making sprites for but also my first cc(s). not much to say other than play chicory its a good game :3</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Rhythm doctor stuff.png" alt="" width="192px" height="108px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">rhythm doctor fanart</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">i've never been able to draw human(s) <s>faces</s> and it's a problem</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="LuciaD.png" alt="" width="135px" height="81px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">luciaD</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">made this for the level 'cyber battle'. again not much to say but i was getting better at making ccs</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Ian is a GAMER.png" alt="" width="59px" height="59px">

  <div class="subtitle">
    <p style="margin:6px;"><u>29th may 2021 - 14th november 2021</u></p>
    <p style="margin:6px;">here's where i started working on my own stuff and fanart ,also frogs</p>
  </div><br>
  <div class="rowA">
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="torterra.png" alt="" width="151px" height="116px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">pokemon torterra fanart</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">for one of my earliest pieces of pixel art i still think it looks pretty good, albeit i relied heavily on a reference and the parts where i had to use creative liberties like the tree look super flat. also i didnt know what hue shifting was lmao</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Frgo.png" alt="" width="64px" height="64px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">frg</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">recognise this guy? fun fact this is the first thing i ever made with aseprite. yeah</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Frogs.png" alt="" width="435px" height="423px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">2021 halloween art month</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">the first and last art month i've fully completed and it's all the same frog. my art style has improved a lot since i made this but it was a useful learning experience. also look at that house lma</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="forgs.png" alt="" width="43px" height="32px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">bloop and ?</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">i completely forgot about this one! this is the original design for bloop, as well as a bard character i never used. who knows maybe it'll show up in the future. probably not.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <br>
  <div class="subtitle">
    <p style="margin:6px;"><u>15th march 2020 - 15th march 2021</u></p>
    <p style="margin:6px;">the beginning of my journey into pixel art. i did make a couple minecraft skins before doing terraria sprites but i consider this the actual starting point. the sprites in question were for a terraria mod which unfortunately stopped getting support and never got ported to 1.4. it taught me a few things but eventually i moved on</p>
  </div><br>
  <div class="rowA">
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Gold_Armor_Resprite.png" alt="" width="80px" height="92px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">gold armour resprite</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">despite the name being gold armour resprite this was intended for a different armour set altogether. honestly it looks pretty good</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Leafeon_But_More.png" alt="" width="64px" height="60px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">leafeon squirrel resprite</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">this actually wasn't intended for the mod but instead for a friend's texture pack which would've replaced critters with eevelutions. unfortunately it was never finished</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columnA">
      <img src="Some_Chandelier.png" alt="" width="38px" height="38px">
      <h4 style="margin:6px;">chandelier</h4>
      <p style="margin:6px;">i dont remember why i made this one</p>
